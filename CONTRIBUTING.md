# Join us!

We invite all contributors to join the [Online UI/UX Hackfest](https://www.jenkins.io/events/online-hackfest/2020-uiux/) on May 25-29!
This hackfest is NOT a hackathon.
We do not expect participants to dedicate all their time during the event timeframe, but hop-in/hop-out as their time allows.
Everybody can spend as much time as they are willing to dedicate.
Jenkins development experience is not required, we have newcomer-friendly stories for those who want to start contributing to the project.
We will also have a 24/7 jenkinsci/hackfest Gitter chat for Q&A and coordination between contributors.

See the [main page](./README.md) for more information and links
